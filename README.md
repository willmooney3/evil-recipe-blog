# Evil Recipe Blog
You know those recipe blogs that tell a whole life story
before they show you the recipe? This is one of those. Except
ChatGPT generates more story as you scroll. And you never get
to the recipe.

This is the single, most evil thing I have ever devised.
Please don't use it.

Seriously, though, you ever have an idea pop into your head
and just want to build it? That's all this was.

Pretty much all of it was generated by ChatGPT, including the
images. I wasn't going to spend real time on this.

## How to Run
```
export CHATGPT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
npm install
npm run start
```
